# Full Release Workflow (@latest)
#
# This workflow creates stable releases of ENSNode packages and Docker images.
# It is triggered automatically when the Changesets Release PR is merged to main.
#
# How it works:
# 1. When PRs with changesets are merged to main, the Changesets bot creates/updates a Release PR
# 2. When the Release PR is merged, this workflow:
#    - Publishes NPM packages with @latest tag
#    - Builds and publishes Docker images to GitHub Container Registry with @latest tag
#    - Creates a GitHub release with version tags and release notes
#    - Sends Slack notification
#
# Published artifacts:
# - NPM packages: @ensnode/* packages published to npm registry with @latest tag
# - Docker images: ensindexer, ensadmin, ensapi, ensrainbow published to ghcr.io with @latest tag
# - GitHub Release: Created with version tag (e.g., v1.2.3) and autogenerated release notes
#
# Version management:
# - All ENSNode packages use "fixed" versioning - they all advance to the same version
# - The version is determined by the changesets included in the Release PR
# - Version bump type (major/minor/patch) is based on the changeset severity levels
#
# Important notes:
# - Only Full Releases are considered stable for production use
# - Only NameHash Labs ensnode team members can merge the Release PR
# - This workflow does NOT run on regular commits to main (see release_snapshot.yml for that)
# - GitHub releases and tags are only created for Full Releases
#
