      # This will run the dev command in background, and wait up to
      # HEALTH_CHECK_TIMEOUT seconds. It will monitor the log output to
      # ensure the app healthcheck is live. If the command does not
      # print the log with the healthcheck message within that time, the step
      # will exit with a failure.
      # This runtime check uses a pglite database that only lives in the CI
      # environment. It will be discarded after the CI run. The app will not
      # check anything beyond the healthcheck as its job is to ensure the app
      # starts successfully only. With the configured RPCs there is likely to
      # be rate limits hit but we do not care for those.
