/**
 * Beautifies a name by converting each normalized label in the provided name to
 * its "beautified" form. Labels that are not normalized retain their original value.
 *
 * Invariants:
 * - The number of labels in the returned name is the same as the number of labels in the input name.
 * - The order of the labels in the returned name is the same as the order of the labels in the input name.
 * - If a label in the input is normalized, it is returned in its "beautified" form.
 * - If a label in the input name is not normalized, it is returned without modification.
 * - Therefore, the result of ens_normalize(beautifyName(name)) is the same as the result of ens_normalize(name).
 *
 * The "beautified form" of a normalized label converts special sequences of
 * emojis and other special characters to their "beautified" equivalents. All
 * such conversions transform X -> Y where Y is normalizable and normalizes back to X.
 * Ex: '1⃣2⃣' (normalized) to '1️⃣2️⃣' (normalizable but not normalized).
 * Ex: 'ξethereum' (normalized) to 'Ξethereum' (normalizable, but not normalized).
 * Ex: 'abc' (normalized) to 'abc' (also normalized, no conversion).
 * Ex: 'ABC' (normalizable but not normalized) to 'ABC' (no conversion).
 * Ex: 'invalid|label' (not normalizable) to 'invalid|label' (no conversion).
 * Ex: '' (unnormalized as a label) to '' (no conversion).
 *
 * @param name - The name to beautify.
 * @returns The beautified name.
