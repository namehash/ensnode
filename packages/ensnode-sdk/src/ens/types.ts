 * A DNS-Encoded Name as a hex string, representing the binary DNS wire format encoding

 * @example "0x07766974616c696b03657468000" represents "vitalik.eth"
 *
 * @see https://docs.ens.domains/resolution/names/#dns-encoding
 * @see https://github.com/ensdomains/ens-contracts/blob/staging/contracts/utils/NameCoder.sol
 *
 * DNS Packet Format for Domain Names:
 * - Domain names are encoded as a sequence of labels
 * - Each label begins with a length byte (1 byte) indicating how many bytes follow for that label
 * - The bytes after the length byte represent the characters in the label
 * - Labels are concatenated with no separators
 * - The sequence ends with a zero-length byte (0x00)
 *
 * Example: "example.eth" is encoded as:
 * [0x07, 'e', 'x', 'a', 'm', 'p', 'l', 'e', 0x03, 'e', 't', 'h', 0x00]
 * Where 0x07 is the length of "example", 0x03 is the length of "eth", and 0x00 marks the end
