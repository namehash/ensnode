 * Internal APIs

 *
 * This file can never be included in the NPM package for ENSNode SDK.
 *
 * The only way to import functionality from this file is to
 * use `@ensnode/ensnode-sdk/internal` path. This path is available in any
 * app/package in the monorepo which requires `@ensnode/ensnode-sdk` dependency.
