# ENSNode SDK

This package is a set of libraries enabling smooth interaction with ENSNode services and data, including shared types, data processing (such as validating data and enforcing invariants), and ENS-oriented helper functions.

Learn more about [ENSNode](https://ensnode.io/) from [the ENSNode docs](https://ensnode.io/docs/).

  texts: ["avatar", "com.twitter"],
});

// Resolution API (Reverse Resolution)
