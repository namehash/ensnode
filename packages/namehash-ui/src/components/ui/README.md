# Attention

All the files in this directory are part of [shadcn/ui's suite of reusable components](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components), and **shouldn't be modified** at all. 

If you want to create a similar component with slightly different behavior/UI, create a separate file where you use the shadcn's components as base and introduce your changes there. For an example see the [EnsAvatar](../identity/EnsAvatar.tsx) component.
