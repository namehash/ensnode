/**
 * ENSDeployments maps from an ENSDeploymentChain to an ENSDeployment.
 *
 * Each "ENS deployment" is a single, unified namespace of ENS names with a distinct onchain root
 * Registry but with the capability of spanning from that root Registry across many `Datasource`s that
 * may be distributed across multiple chains and offchain resources.
 *
 * For example, as of 9-Feb-2025 the canonical "ENS deployment" on mainnet includes:
 * - A root Registry on mainnet.
 * - An onchain Registrar for direct subnames of 'eth' on mainnet.
 * - An onchain Registry and Registrar for direct subnames of 'base.eth' on Base.
 * - An onchain Registry and Registrar subregistry for direct subnames of 'linea.eth' on Linea.
 * - An offchain subregistry for subnames of '.cb.id'.
 * - An offchain subregistry for subnames of '.uni.eth'.
 * - Etc..
 *
 * Each "ENS deployment" is logically independent of & isolated from the others.
 * For example, the Sepolia and Holesky testnet "ENS deployments" are independent of the canonical
 * "ENS deployment" on mainnet.
 *
 * 'ens-test-env' represents an "ENS deployment" running on a local Anvil chain for testing
 * protocol changes, running deterministic test suites, and local development.
