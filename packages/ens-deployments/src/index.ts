 * Note that here, we define the global ENSDeploymentGlobalType type based off mainnet (which fully
 * specifies all plugin configs). This type will be used to cast each specific ENSDeployment type
 * to the global type in order to ensure that at type-check-time and in `ALL_PLUGINS` every plugin's
 * `config` has valid values (and therefore its type can continue to be inferred).
 *
 * This means that initially upon building the
 * plugin configs, if the user is selecting a deployment that does not fully specify every available
 * plugin, the plugins that are not in that deployment's specification are technically pointing at
 * the mainnet deployment. This is never an issue, however, as those plugin are filtered out
 * (see ponder.config.ts and `getActivePlugins`) and never activated.

/**
 * ENSDeployments maps from an ENSDeploymentChain to an ENSDeployment.
 *
 * Each "ENS deployment" is a single, unified namespace of ENS names with a distinct onchain root
 * Registry but with the capability of spanning from that root Registry across many `Datasource`s that
 * may be distributed across multiple chains and offchain resources.
 *
 * For example, as of 9-Feb-2025 the canonical "ENS deployment" on mainnet includes:
 * - A root Registry on mainnet.
 * - An onchain Registrar for direct subnames of 'eth' on mainnet.
 * - An onchain Registry and Registrar for direct subnames of 'base.eth' on Base.
 * - An onchain Registry and Registrar subregistry for direct subnames of 'linea.eth' on Linea.
 * - An offchain subregistry for subnames of '.cb.id'.
 * - An offchain subregistry for subnames of '.uni.eth'.
 * - Etc..
 *
 * Each "ENS deployment" is logically independent of & isolated from the others.
 * For example, the Sepolia and Holesky testnet "ENS deployments" are independent of the canonical
 * "ENS deployment" on mainnet.
 *
 * 'ens-test-env' represents an "ENS deployment" running on a local Anvil chain for testing
 * protocol changes, running deterministic test suites, and local development.
