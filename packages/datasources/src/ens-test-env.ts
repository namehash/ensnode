/**
 * The ens-test-env ENSDeployment
 *
 * 'ens-test-env' represents an "ENS deployment" running on a local Anvil chain for development of
 * ENS apps and running test suites against a deterministic deployment of the ENS protocol.
 * https://github.com/ensdomains/ens-test-env
 *
 * The 'ens-test-env' ENSDeployment is only relevant in the context of apps that use the ens-test-env
 * tool (i.e. ensjs and ens-app-v3) and it depends on the addresses of the contracts deployed by
 * that app (each app deploys the ENS protocol to slightly different addresses).
 *
 * In both ensjs and ens-app-v3, an env variable is available to the ens-test-env tool that
 * lists the addresses of each contract after deployment. These addresses are different in each
 * app and may change over time.
 *
 * If the addresses are not available in the environment, we use empty string as a mock to ensure
 * type-correctness: consumers of this ens-test-env deployment, if using outside of the context
 * of the ens-test-env tool, should validate that an Address is provided, or they may experience
 * undefined runtime behavior.
