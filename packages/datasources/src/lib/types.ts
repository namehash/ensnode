/**
 * ENSNamespaces encodes the set of well-known ENS namespaces.
 *
 * Each ENS namespace is a single, unified set of ENS names with a distinct onchain root
 * Registry (the ensroot Datasource) and the capability of spanning from that root Registry across
 * other `Datasource`s that may be distributed across multiple chains and offchain resources.
 *
 * For example, as of 9-Feb-2025 the canonical ENS namespace on mainnet includes:
 * - A root Registry on mainnet.
 * - An onchain Registrar for direct subnames of 'eth' on mainnet.
 * - An onchain Registry and Registrar for direct subnames of 'base.eth' on Base.
 * - An onchain Registry and Registrar subregistry for direct subnames of 'linea.eth' on Linea.
 * - An offchain subregistry for subnames of '.cb.id'.
 * - An offchain subregistry for subnames of '.uni.eth'.
 * - Etc..
 *
 * Each ENS namespace is logically independent of & isolated from the others, and not exclusively
 * correlated with a specific L1 chain. For example, the Sepolia and Holesky testnet ENS namepaces
 * are independent of the canonical ENS namespace on mainnet, and there could be an additional
 * deployment of the ENS protocol to mainnet, configured with different Datasources, resulting in a
 * logically isolated set of ENS names.
 *
 * 'ens-test-env' represents an ENS namespace running on a local Anvil chain for testing
 * protocol changes, running deterministic test suites, and local development.
