The easiest way to run ENSAdmin is via Docker container.

## Running with Docker

ENSAdmin is deployed as a Single Page React Application served by nginx on port 4173.

### Using pre-built image

```bash
docker run \
  -d \
  -p 4173:4173 \
  ghcr.io/namehash/ensnode/ensadmin:latest
```

### Running with custom ENSNode URLs

To configure the server connection library:

```bash
docker run -d \
  -p 4173:4173 \
  -e NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_CONNECTION_LIBRARY=http://localhost:42069 \
  ghcr.io/namehash/ensnode/ensadmin:latest
```

The `NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_CONNECTION_LIBRARY` environment variable accepts a comma-separated list of ENSNode URLs that will be offered as connection options in the ENSAdmin interface.
