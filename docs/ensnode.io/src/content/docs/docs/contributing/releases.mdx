We use [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to manage version bumps and release notes for our NPM packages and Docker images (ENSIndexer, ENSAdmin, and ENSRainbow).

## Adding a Changeset to Your PR

When you open a PR with feature or bug fix changes, you'll need to include a changeset file that documents your changes:

1. Run `changeset` or `pnpm changeset` in the repository root
2. Select the packages/apps your changes affect using the interactive prompt
3. Choose whether your changes are "major" (breaking changes), "minor" (features), or "patch" (bug fixes).
4. Write a clear description of your changes - this will appear in the release notes

The `changesets/bot` will automatically comment on your PR to either remind you to add a changeset or confirm the version changes that will happen when your PR is merged.

**Important notes:**
- Changesets are only required for user-facing changes (features, bug fixes)
- You don't need a changeset for documentation changes or internal refactoring
- All our packages use "fixed" versioning - they all share the same version number regardless of which package triggered the version bump

## Upon a New Release

Upon the publishing of a new release, your change will be included in the produced packages/images and your contributions will be referenced in the GitHub Release notes.
