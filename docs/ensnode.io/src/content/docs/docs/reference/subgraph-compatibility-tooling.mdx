The tools in the [ens-subgraph-transition-tools](https://github.com/namehash/ens-subgraph-transition-tools) repository help users verify ENSNode's subgraph-compatibility.

1. `snapshot-eq` â€” verify subgraph-equivalant data via snapshots at specific blockheights
2. ðŸš§ `proxy-eq` â€” verify live query compatibility & easing migrations from the Subgraph to ENSNode by identifying any response discrepancies while using an app in real-time

See the [ens-subgraph-transition-tools](https://github.com/namehash/ens-subgraph-transition-tools) README for additional context and usage instructions.
