ENSNode v1 provides an ENS Subgraph-Compatible GraphQL endpoint for the purposes of:

1. Demonstrating 1:1 reproduction of the ENS Subgraph's logic & data
   - the ENS Subgraph has been adopted by the community as an important resource for ENS protocol data, and confidence in ENSNode's implementation is demanded
2. Plug-and-Play compatibility for those that wish to host their own ENS indexer
   - deploying ENSNode is faster and easier than running an ENS Subgraph instance
   - 100% compatibility with `ensjs` eases community adoption of ENSNode
3. Gradual migration from the subgraph
   - users may wish to gradually migrate from the subgraph & its API to ENSNode's Subgraph API

## Configuration

To enable full ENS Subgraph compatibility, configure ENSIndexer with `SUBGRAPH_COMPAT=true`. This single flag:

1. **Applies Subgraph Indexing Behavior**: Uses Subgraph Interpreted Labels and Names, allowing unnormalized labels to be returned as they appear in the original ENS Subgraph
2. **Sets Default Plugins & Label Set**: Defaults to `PLUGINS=subgraph`, `LABEL_SET_ID=subgraph` and `LABEL_SET_VERSION=0` to match subgraph indexing logic and label healing behavior

When `SUBGRAPH_COMPAT=false` (default), ENSIndexer operates in enhanced mode with:

- **Enhanced Indexing Behavior**: Uses Interpreted Labels and Names with improved security by encoding unnormalized labels as labelhashes
- **Expanded Plugin Support**: Defaults to `PLUGINS=subgraph,basenames,lineanames,threedns` for multichain ENS indexing
- **Reverse Address Healing**: Attempts to heal subnames of addr.reverse for enhanced reverse resolution support

### Migration from Legacy Configuration

If you were previously using the individual configuration flags, migrate as follows:

```bash
# Legacy configuration for subgraph compatibility
HEAL_REVERSE_ADDRESSES=false
INDEX_ADDITIONAL_RESOLVER_RECORDS=false
REPLACE_UNNORMALIZED=false

# New simplified configuration
SUBGRAPH_COMPAT=true
```

## Compatibility Tooling

ENSNode has developed tooling to verify subgraph compatibility and ease migration from the ENS Subgraph.

### Unplanned Features

The following features of the subgraph graphql api are explicitly unsupported and are not planned.

- [1-level-nested Entity `_orderBy` param](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/subgraphs/querying/graphql-api/#example-for-nested-entity-sorting)
- [time travel queries](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/subgraphs/querying/graphql-api/#time-travel-queries)

### Well-Known Queries

These are some of the popular queries we've seen in the wild (namely via ENSjs and ens-app-v3)—the Subgraph-compatible GraphQL API includes full compatibility with these use-cases (and all other possible queries with the exceptions listed above).
