ENSNode v1 provides an ENS Subgraph-Compatible GraphQL endpoint for the purposes of:

1. Demonstrating 1:1 reproduction of the ENS Subgraph's logic & data
    - the ENS Subgraph has been adopted by the community as an important resource for ENS protocol data, and confidence in ENSNode's implementation is demanded
2. Plug-and-Play compatibility for those that wish to host their own ENS indexer
    - deploying ENSNode is faster and easier than running an ENS Subgraph instance
    - 100% compatibility with `ensjs` eases community adoption of ENSNode
3. Gradual migration from the subgraph
    - users may wish to gradually migrate from the subgraph & its api to ENSNode's api
    - the built-in Ponder GraphQL api provides more efficient querying (esp. pagination) semantics
    - the built-in `@ponder/client` provides a smoother devx for retrieving data within a client app

## Compatibility Tooling

ENSNode has developed tooling to verify subgraph compatibility and ease migration from the ENS Subgraph.

## Subgraph-Compatible GraphQL API Reference

### Supported Features

The feature set used by `ensjs` and `ens-app-v3` is fully supported: see the [well-known queries](#well-known-queries) section below.

There exists a [fork of ens-test-env](https://github.com/namehash/ens-test-env/) that uses ENSNode instead of the ENS Subgraph. It's this fork of `ens-test-env` that is used to run the [ensjs](https://github.com/namehash/ensjs) test suite against ENSNode.

### Planned Features

- any open [issues](https://github.com/namehash/ensnode/issues) regarding Subgraph-Compatibility
- [subgraph `_Meta_` object](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/subgraphs/querying/graphql-api/#subgraph-metadata)

## Possible Features

The following features could be implemented, but are not yet planned.

- [fulltext search queries](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/subgraphs/querying/graphql-api/#fulltext-search-queries)

### Unplanned Features

The following features of the subgraph graphql api are explicitly unsupported and are not planned.

- [1-level-nested Entity `_orderBy` param](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/subgraphs/querying/graphql-api/#example-for-nested-entity-sorting)
- [time travel queries](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/subgraphs/querying/graphql-api/#time-travel-queries)
- [_change_block filtering](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/subgraphs/querying/graphql-api/#example-for-block-filtering)

### Well-Known Queries

These are some of the popular queries we've seen in the wild (namely via ENSjs and ens-app-v3)—the Subgraph-compatible GraphQL API includes full compatibility with these use-cases (and all other possible queries with the exceptions listed above).
