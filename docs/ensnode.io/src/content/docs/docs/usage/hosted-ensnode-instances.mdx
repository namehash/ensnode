## Hosted Instances

NameHash Labs provides freely available hosted instances for ENS developers looking to get started quickly.

These instances are provided free of charge with no API key required, have no rate limiting, and are maintained and monitored by the NameHash Labs team.

:::caution[No Uptime / Performance Guarantees]
These hosted instances are provided free of charge to the ENS community, and while we strive for strong uptime and performance, neither of these can be guaranteed. By using these instances you accept the possibility of downtime, degraded performance, or other unforeseen events. If you'd like to run ENSNode in production, consider [hosting your own ENSNode instance](/ensnode/deploying/).

## Available ENSNode Instances

The key differences between these hosted deployments is the ENS deployment being indexed (mainnet vs a testnet) and the list of ENSNode plugins that are activated. See the table below for details.
Main difference from client perspective is chain being indexed and list of plugins being handled. Here is the table listing differences between those.

### Alpha-style Deployments

These ENSNode instances focus on pushing the boundaries of what's possible with ENSNode.

#### ENSNode 'Alpha'
<HostedEnsNodeInstances
    instanceURL="https://api.alpha.ensnode.io"
    connectWithENSAdminURL="https://admin.ensnode.io/status?ensnode=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.alpha.ensnode.io"
    namespace="mainnet"
    plugins="subgraph, basenames, lineanames, threedns"
    purpose="Demonstration of ENSNode's multichain ENS indexing capability for the ENS namespace rooted on Mainnet. Provides a superset of the data indexed by the ENS Subgraph. Indexes additional Resolver record values in preparation for ENS Protocol Acceleration."
/>

#### ENSNode 'Alpha-Sepolia'
<HostedEnsNodeInstances
    instanceURL="https://api.alpha-sepolia.ensnode.io"
    connectWithENSAdminURL="https://admin.ensnode.io/status?ensnode=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.alpha-sepolia.ensnode.io"
    namespace="sepolia"
    plugins="subgraph, basenames, lineanames"
    purpose="Demonstration of ENSNode's multichain ENS indexing capability for the ENS namespace rooted on Sepolia. Provides a superset of the data indexed by the ENS Subgraph. Indexes additional Resolver record values in preparation for ENS Protocol Acceleration."
/>

### Subgraph-style Deployments

These ENSNode instances focus on maximizing backwards compatibility with the ENS Subgraph.

#### ENSNode 'Mainnet'
<HostedEnsNodeInstances
    instanceURL="https://api.mainnet.ensnode.io"
    connectWithENSAdminURL="https://admin.ensnode.io/status?ensnode=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.mainnet.ensnode.io"
    namespace="mainnet"
    plugins="subgraph"
    purpose="Demonstration of ENSNode's backwards compatibility with the ENS Subgraph. Provides 1:1 Subgraph compatible data on mainnet."
/>

#### ENSNode 'Sepolia'
<HostedEnsNodeInstances
    instanceURL="https://api.sepolia.ensnode.io"
    connectWithENSAdminURL="https://admin.ensnode.io/status?ensnode=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.sepolia.ensnode.io"
    namespace="sepolia"
    plugins="subgraph"
    purpose="Demonstration of ENSNode's backwards compatibility with the ENS Subgraph. Provides 1:1 Subgraph compatible data on Sepolia."
/>

#### ENSNode 'Holesky'
<HostedEnsNodeInstances
    instanceURL="https://api.holesky.ensnode.io"
    connectWithENSAdminURL="https://admin.ensnode.io/status?ensnode=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.holesky.ensnode.io"
    namespace="holesky"
    plugins="subgraph"
    purpose="Demonstration of ENSNode's backwards compatibility with the ENS Subgraph. Provides 1:1 Subgraph compatible data on Holesky."
/>
