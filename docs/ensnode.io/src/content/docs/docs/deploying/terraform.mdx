This guide will help you deploy ENSNode using Terraform to Railway. The Terraform configuration provides a complete infrastructure setup including database, ENSIndexer, ENSRainbow, and other required services.

:::note[Important]
These Terraform scripts are currently specific to ENSNode instances hosted by NameHash Labs. While these scripts provide a good starting point for deploying your own ENSNode instance, you will need to make modifications to suit your specific deployment needs. We plan to generalize these scripts in the future to better support community deployments.

## Prerequisites

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) installed
- [Railway](https://railway.app/) account
- Railway API token (generate from https://railway.com/account/tokens)
- RPC URLs for the networks you want to support (Mainnet, Sepolia, Holesky, Base, Linea)
- AWS account (for DNS management)
- AWS S3 bucket defined inside AWS account - `ensnode-terraform` (for Terraform state)

## Configuration

Copy `.env.sample` to `.env.local` and fill in your configuration values:

```bash
railway_token    = "your_railway_token"
mainnet_rpc_url  = "your_mainnet_rpc_url"
sepolia_rpc_url  = "your_sepolia_rpc_url"
holesky_rpc_url  = "your_holesky_rpc_url"
base_rpc_url     = "your_base_rpc_url"
linea_rpc_url    = "your_linea_rpc_url"
ensnode_version  = "latest"  # or specific version
```

## Infrastructure Components

The Terraform configuration sets up the following components:

- Railway
  - Railway project and environment
  - PostgreSQL database
  - ENSIndexer services
  - ENSRainbow service
- AWS
  - DNS configuration

## Deployment Steps

1. Initialize Terraform:
```bash
terraform init
```

2. Review the planned changes:
```bash
terraform plan
```

3. Apply the configuration:
```bash
terraform apply
```

## Cleanup

To destroy the infrastructure:

```bash
terraform destroy
```
