NameHash Labs operates a freely available instance of ENSRainbow for the ENS community.

| Provider | URL | Rate Limit |
|----------|-----|------------|
| NameHash Labs | https://api.ensrainbow.io | None |

This service:
- Is provided free of charge with no API key required
- Has no rate limiting
- Is maintained and monitored by the NameHash Labs team
- Runs the latest version of ENSRainbow

While we aim for high availability, if you need guaranteed uptime or want to keep your requests private, we recommend running your own instance.
