## Why Label Sets & Versions?

A **label set** (see [Glossary](/ensrainbow/concepts/glossary/) for definition) is analogous to a _dataset snapshot_. Every time the upstream data (e.g. an on-chain subgraph export) changes, we mint a new **label set version** so that:

### 1. Deterministic Results
Clients that pin _version `N`_ are guaranteed to get the _exact same_ heal response today, tomorrow, and two years from now.

### 2. Decentralized Ecosystem
Anyone can create and publish their own labelsets, opening ENSRainbow as a solution for the wider ENS ecosystem. Distinct `labelSetId` values enable diverse data sources, community-driven curation, and maintenance of labelhash-to-label mappings.

### 3. Extensibility Across Time
Label sets can grow organically as new labelhash-to-label mappings are discovered. Each new version incrementally adds fresh data without invalidating previous versions, ensuring applications can evolve their data coverage while maintaining backward compatibility.

## Version Management

### Label Set IDs
- String (1-50 chars) consisting of lowercase ASCII letters and hyphens
- Examples: `subgraph`, `discovery-a`, `ens-test-env`
- Each ID represents a different data source or curation strategy

### Label Set Versions
- Non-negative integers that increase monotonically: `0`, `1`, `2`, etc.
- Version `0` is always the initial dataset for a given label set ID
- Each new version contains only the new labelhash-to-label mappings added since the previous version

### File Naming Convention
```text
subgraph_0.ensrainbow     # labelSetId = "subgraph", version = 0
subgraph_1.ensrainbow     # next version with incremental labelhash-to-label mappings added
discovery-a_0.ensrainbow  # different dataset, initial version
```

## Client Behavior

When constructing an ENSRainbow client, you can specify versioning preferences:

1. **No constraints** → Always use the latest available version
2. **Pin to label set ID** → Use a specific dataset but stay current
3. **Pin to exact version** → Lock to a specific snapshot for deterministic results

This flexibility ensures applications can choose between **staying current** with the latest data or **maintaining consistency** for reproducible results.
