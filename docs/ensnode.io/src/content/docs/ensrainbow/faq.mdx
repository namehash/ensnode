This page answers the most common questions about ENSRainbow.

## Can I use ENSRainbow without running my own server?
Yes. NameHash Labs operates a free instance at `https://api.ensrainbow.io`.

## How often are new labels added?
New label-set versions are generated manually for now:

- **`subgraph`**: data from the ENS Subgraph rainbow tables, no plans to update
- **`discovery-a`**: may be updated periodically as new labels are dynamically discovered
- **`ens-test-env`**: Static test dataset, no plans to update
- **`searchlight`**: Enhanced discovery dataset with additional label discoveries beyond the subgraph

To stay informed about new versions, monitor the [Available Label Sets](/ensrainbow/usage/available-label-sets/) documentation page.

## How can I create my own .ensrainbow file?

You can create your own `.ensrainbow` files from CSV data using the `convert` command, which generates new `.ensrainbow` files from your supplied CSV input.

1. **Prepare your data** as a CSV file with labels (1 column) or labels and labelhashes (2 columns)
2. **Run the convert command:**
   ```bash
   pnpm run convert \
     --input-file your_labels.csv \
     --output-file custom.ensrainbow \
     --label-set-id my-dataset
   ```

**Note:** You can also download existing `.ensrainbow` files using the download scripts.

For complete instructions, examples, and workflow guidance, see the [Creating ENSRainbow Files](/ensrainbow/concepts/creating-files) guide. See the [CLI Reference](/ensrainbow/contributing/cli-reference/) for detailed command usage.

## Does ENSRainbow normalise labels?
No. It returns labels exactly as stored. Your client should perform ENS Normalisation if required.
