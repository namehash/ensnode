This page answers the most common questions about ENSRainbow.

## Can I use ENSRainbow without running my own server?
Yes. NameHash Labs operates a free instance at `https://api.ensrainbow.io`.

## How often are new labels added?
New label-set versions are generated manually for now:

- **`subgraph`**: data from the ENS Subgraph rainbow tables, no plans to update
- **`discovery-a`**: may be updated periodically as new labels are dynamically discovered
- **`ens-test-env`**: Static test dataset, no plans to update
- **`searchlight`**: Enhanced discovery dataset (coming soon)

To stay informed about new versions, monitor the [Available Label Sets](/ensrainbow/usage/available-label-sets/) documentation page.

## How can I create my own .ensrainbow file?

Currently, the `convert` command is the **only way** to create new `.ensrainbow` files from scratch. This command converts PostgreSQL rainbow table dumps (`.sql.gz` format) into the binary protobuf format that ENSRainbow uses.

**To create a custom .ensrainbow file:**

1. **Prepare your data** as a PostgreSQL dump file (`.sql.gz`) with ENS labels and labelhashes
2. **Run the convert command:**
   ```bash
   pnpm run convert --input-file your_data.sql.gz --output-file custom.ensrainbow
   ```
3. **Specify the label set details** using `--label-set-id` and `--label-set-version` flags

**Note:** You can download existing `.ensrainbow` files using the download scripts, but for creating entirely new files with your own data, the `convert` command is currently the only option available.

See the [CLI Reference](/ensrainbow/contributing/cli-reference/) for detailed command usage.

## Does ENSRainbow normalise labels?
No. It returns labels exactly as stored. Your client should perform ENS Normalisation if required.
