## Graceful Shutdown

ENSRainbow listens for `SIGTERM` and `SIGINT`. Docker (and most PaaS) send these signals on termination, allowing the server to finish in-flight requests before exiting with code 0.

## Database Maintenance

* **Reset database** – stop the server, run `pnpm run purge --data-dir <path>`, and ingest again.
* **Validate database** – `pnpm run validate --data-dir ./data` ensures record integrity.
* **Upgrade label-set** – ingest the next `.ensrainbow` file (version +1). The highest version is reported by `GET /version`.
