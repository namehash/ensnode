This guide covers running ENSRainbow locally for development and contributions.

## Local Development

:::caution[Follow ENSNode's Contribution Guide First]
Follow ENSNode's [contribution guide](/ensnode/contributing/) to prepare your workspace environment & install dependencies.

### Get the Rainbow Tables

Our copies of the ENS rainbow tables are stored in a public bucket. You can download either the legacy (original) or v2 (extended) dataset using the following commands:

```bash
# For legacy data
pnpm run get-legacy-data

# For v2 data
pnpm run get-v2-data
```

These commands will:
- Download the required files (rainbow tables, checksum, and MIT license)
- Automatically verify the checksum
- Place the files in a convenient directory for subsequent use of the ingest command

### Produce Data Directory

Run data ingestion and verify the number of unique label-labelhash pairs in the database:

```bash
pnpm run ingest
```

### Start ENSRainbow

```bash
pnpm run serve
```

You can verify the service is running by checking the health endpoint or retrieving the label count:

```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:3223/health

# Get count of healable labels
curl http://localhost:3223/v1/labels/count
```

Expected count as of January 30, 2024: 133,856,894 unique label-labelhash pairs

## Building the Docker Image

For instructions on building the ENSRainbow Docker image, see the [Building Docker Images](/ensrainbow/contributing/building) guide.

## Service Management

### Graceful Shutdown

The service handles graceful shutdown on SIGTERM and SIGINT signals (e.g., when receiving Ctrl+C or Docker stop commands).

### Database Management

If you need to start fresh with the database:
1. Stop any running ENSRainbow processes
2. Delete the LevelDB data directory (default: './data')
3. Run the ingest command again

## System Requirements

### Data Ingestion Requirements (`ingest` command)

- **Storage**:
  - At least 15 GB of free disk space:
    - 6.37 GB for the compressed rainbow tables download
    - ~7 GB for the LevelDB database after ingestion
    - Additional temporary space during build/ingestion
- **Memory**: At least 4 GB RAM recommended

### API Server Requirements (`serve` command)

- **Storage**: 7.61 GB for the Docker image (pre-built with LevelDB database)
- **Memory**: Minimum 1 GB RAM (4 GB recommended for optimal performance)
- **CPU**: Minimal requirements - operates well with low CPU resources


## Command Line Interface

ENSRainbow provides a command-line interface (CLI) for managing the service. You can view detailed help for any command by adding `--help` after the command:

### Data Ingestion

```bash
pnpm run ingest [--input-file path/to/ens_names.sql.gz] [--data-dir path/to/db]
```

- `input-file`: Path to the gzipped [SQL dump file containing ENS rainbow tables](#getting-the-rainbow-tables) (default: './ens_names.sql.gz'). Only used during data ingestion.
- `data-dir`: Directory for the LevelDB database. If not provided, defaults to `data/`

### Database Validation

```bash
pnpm run validate [--data-dir path/to/db] [--lite]
```

Validates database integrity by:
- Verifying the keys for all rainbow records are valid labelhashes
- Ensuring stored labels match their corresponding labelhashes
- Validating the total rainbow record count
- Verifying no ingestion was interrupted before successful completion

The `--lite` option performs a faster, less thorough validation by skipping hash verification and record count validation. It only checks that:
- The ingestion was completed successfully
- The schema version is correct
- The precalculated count exists and can be retrieved

The process will exit with:
- Code 0: Validation successful
- Code 1: Validation failed or errors encountered

### Database Purge

```bash
pnpm run purge [--data-dir path/to/db]
```
Completely removes all files from the specified data directory. This is useful when you need to start fresh with a clean database.

The process will exit with:
- Code 0: Successful purge
- Code 1: Error during purge operation

### API Server

```bash
pnpm run serve [--port 3223] [--data-dir path/to/db]
```

Starts the API server. The process will exit with:
- Code 0: Clean shutdown
- Code 1: Error during operation


## Using ENSRainbow with ens-test-env

The ens-test-env project provides a test environment for ENS development. It includes a small dataset of ENS names in the `ens_test_env_names.sql.gz` file that can be used with ENSRainbow for testing purposes.

### Ingesting ens_test_env_names.sql.gz

To ingest the test data into ENSRainbow:

```bash
# Navigate to the ENSRainbow directory
cd apps/ensrainbow

# Ingest the test data
pnpm ingest --input-file test/fixtures/ens_test_env_names.sql.gz --data-dir data_ens_test_env
```

### Validating the test data

You can validate the ingested test data to ensure it was properly loaded:

```bash
# Validate the test data
pnpm validate --data-dir data_ens_test_env
```

### Running ENSRainbow with the test data

After ingesting the test data, you can run ENSRainbow with the test data:

```bash
# Start the ENSRainbow server with the test data
pnpm serve --data-dir data_ens_test_env --port 3223
```

### Using with Docker

You can also build a Docker image with the test data:

```bash
# Build a Docker image with the test data
docker build -f apps/ensrainbow/Dockerfile.data \
  --build-arg DATA_VERSION=test \
  -t ghcr.io/namehash/ensnode/ensrainbow-ens-test-env-data .

# Build the ENSRainbow image with the test data
docker build -f apps/ensrainbow/Dockerfile \
  --build-arg DATA_IMAGE_NAME=ensrainbow-ens-test-env-data \
  -t ghcr.io/namehash/ensnode/ensrainbow-ens-test-env .

# Run the ENSRainbow container with the test data
docker run -p 3223:3223 ghcr.io/namehash/ensnode/ensrainbow-ens-test-env
```

This test environment setup is particularly useful for running ENS tests (i.e. ens-test-env) that require label healing capabilities without needing the full production dataset.
