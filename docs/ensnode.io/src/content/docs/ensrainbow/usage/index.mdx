## Usage Patterns

### Quick API Integration
If you just need to heal a few labelhashes occasionally, the HTTP API is perfect:

```bash
curl https://api.ensrainbow.io/v1/heal/0xaf2caa1c2ca1d027f1ac823b529d0a67cd144264b2789fa2ea4d63a67c7103cc
```

### Production Applications
For production applications with consistent usage, consider:

1. **Use the [Client SDK](/ensrainbow/usage/client-sdk/)** for type safety and built-in retry logic
2. **Pin to specific [label set versions](/ensrainbow/concepts/label-sets-and-versioning/)** for deterministic results
3. **Implement client-side caching** to reduce API calls
4. **Consider [self-hosting](/ensrainbow/deploying/)** which is required when running your own ENSNode or for other high-volume use cases

### Enterprise Integration
For enterprise or high-volume applications:

1. **Deploy your own instance** using our [deployment guides](/ensrainbow/deploying/)
2. **Configure appropriate [system requirements](/ensrainbow/contributing/system-requirements/)**
3. **Set up monitoring** with the `/health` and `/count` endpoints
4. **Review [performance characteristics](/ensrainbow/concepts/performance/)**

## Next Steps
