ENSRainbow can be configured via environment variables.

## Environment Variables

ENSRainbow uses two distinct categories of environment variables with different purposes and scopes.

### Runtime Configuration

These variables are read by the ENSRainbow application during startup and operation:

- **`PORT`**: Server port (default: 3223)
- **`LOG_LEVEL`**: Logging level, one of: "debug", "info", "warn", "error" (default: "info")

### Database Download Configuration

These variables are **only used by shell scripts** for downloading and setting up pre-built databases. **The ENSRainbow application itself does not read these environment variables** - it gets label set information from the database after setup is complete.

- **`ENSRAINBOW_LABELSET_SERVER_URL`**: The base URL of the ENSRainbow Labelset Server.
  - **Goal**: To decentralize data sourcing. This allows any user to host their own pre-built ENSRainbow databases and configure their application to use them.
  - **Configuration**: Set this to the base URL of your chosen server. Defaults to `https://bucket.ensrainbow.io`.
  - **Used by**: Docker entrypoint script and manual download scripts only.

- **`DB_SCHEMA_VERSION`**: Specifies the database schema version (e.g., `3`). This determines the format and structure of the pre-built ENSRainbow database archives and is not related to the API version.
  - **Goal**: Ensures compatibility between the ENSRainbow software and the structure of downloaded database files that are prebuilt for startup-time optimizations.
  - **Configuration**: It is strongly recommended to use the latest available schema version unless you have specific compatibility requirements.
  - **Used by**: Download scripts to fetch the correct database format.

- **`LABEL_SET_ID`**: The identifier for a **label set** (see [Glossary](/ensrainbow/concepts/glossary/) for definition).
  - **Goal**: To enable the extensible definition of new label sets (e.g., subgraph vs. production vs. test).
  - **Configuration**: See the [Available Label Sets](/ensrainbow/usage/available-label-sets) page for a complete list of currently available label set IDs and their descriptions.
  - **Used by**: Download scripts to fetch the correct label set.

- **`LABEL_SET_VERSION`**: A non-negative integer representing the version of a **label set** (see [Glossary](/ensrainbow/concepts/glossary/) for definition).
  - **Goal**: To support the deterministic evolution of datasets over time, allowing services to achieve reproducible results.
  - **Configuration**: Use the highest available version number for the most up-to-date data. Versions are sequential and incremental:
    - `0` - The initial/base version of the **label set**.
    - `1`, `2`, etc. - Incremental updates to the **label set**.
  - **Used by**: Download scripts to fetch the correct label set version.

### Example Combinations

```bash
# Latest production data
DB_SCHEMA_VERSION=3 LABEL_SET_ID=subgraph LABEL_SET_VERSION=0

# The ens-test-env data
DB_SCHEMA_VERSION=3 LABEL_SET_ID=ens-test-env LABEL_SET_VERSION=0

# Extended discovery data
DB_SCHEMA_VERSION=3 LABEL_SET_ID=discovery-a LABEL_SET_VERSION=0
```

:::caution[Environment Variables Scope]
The database download variables (`ENSRAINBOW_LABELSET_SERVER_URL`, `DB_SCHEMA_VERSION`, `LABEL_SET_ID`, `LABEL_SET_VERSION`) are **only used by download scripts** and Docker's entrypoint script to fetch pre-built databases. **The ENSRainbow application itself does not read these environment variables** - it gets label set information from the database after it's been set up.

**When you need these variables:**
- Running with Docker (handled automatically by entrypoint script)
- Using manual download scripts to fetch pre-built databases
- Initial database setup

**When you DON'T need these variables:**
- Running ENSRainbow directly after database is already set up
- Normal ENSRainbow operations (server reads label set info from database)
