:::note
This guide covers running ENSNode locally for development and contributions.
:::

### Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Postgres 17](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
  - It's recommended you install Node.js through [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/).
  - see `.nvmrc` and `.tool-versions` for the specific version of Node.js
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)
  - Run `npm install -g pnpm` or see [other installation options](https://pnpm.io/installation).

### Prepare Workspace

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:namehash/ensnode.git
cd ensnode
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Running ENSNode

:::note
ENSNode is a suite of services, and some depend on others. Refer to the `docker-compose.yml` at the root of the monorepo for a full spec on the relationship between services.

/>
:::

### Configuring Environment Variables

```bash
cd apps/ensindexer
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

<LinkCard
  title="Environment Variable Configuration Options"
  href="/ensnode/usage/configuration"
/>

:::note
ENSIndexer's `.env.local` should be placed at `apps/ensindexer/.env.local`, _not_ at the monorepo root.
:::

#### 1. Running Postgres

Ensure Postgres in the background, providing its connection details to ENSIndexer via `DATABASE_URL`.

#### 2. Running ENSRainbow

:::note[Running ENSRainbow in Development]
To run ENSRainbow in development, the rainbow table data dir must be available. Follow instructions in the [ENSRainbow Contribution Guide](/ensrainbow/contributing) to set up your local environment.
:::

```bash
pnpm run serve
```

#### 3. Running ENSIndexer

```bash
# from monorepo root
pnpm run -F ensindexer dev

# or from apps/ensindexer
pnpm run dev
```

#### 4. Running ENSAdmin

```bash
cd apps/ensadmin
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

```bash
# from monorepo root
pnpm run -F ensadmin dev

# or from apps/ensadmin
pnpm run dev
```

:::note
ENSAdmins's `.env.local` should be placed at `apps/ensadmin/.env.local`, _not_ at the monorepo root.
:::

## Using Docker Compose

You can use Docker Compose to set up the ENSNode suite, along with its dependencies.

:::note[Docker in Development]
Re-building Docker containers is slow and inefficient, and doesn't lend itself to rapid development. The first half of this guide showed how to run ENSNode on your host machine, for faster iteration and maximum control. The Docker Compose spec is helpful for describing the suite of services and running them in a structured way, which we'll discuss below.
:::

### Prerequisites

Before you can use Docker Compose, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Running the Applications

To start the ENSNode services using Docker Compose, follow these steps:

```bash
docker compose up
```

- **ENSIndexer**: Available at [http://localhost:42069](http://localhost:42069)
- **ENSRainbow**: Available at [http://localhost:3223](http://localhost:3223)
- **ENSAdmin**: Available at [http://localhost:4173](http://localhost:4173)
- **PostgreSQL**: Available on port `5432`

### Stopping the Applications

To stop the running applications, you can press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal where Docker Compose is running. If you want to remove the containers and networks created by Docker Compose, you can run:

```bash
docker compose down
```

:::note[Postgres Volume in this `docker-compose.yml`]
`docker compoe down` will _not_ delete the Postgres data volume defined here, as it is a **named** volume. To fully delete the Postgres data volume and start from scratch, use `docker compose down -v`.

## Building Docker Images
