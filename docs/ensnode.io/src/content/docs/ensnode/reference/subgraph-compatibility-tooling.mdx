The tools in the [ens-subgraph-transition-tools](https://github.com/namehash/ens-subgraph-transition-tools) repository help users verify ENSNode's subgraph-compatibility.

1. `snapshot-eq` — verify subgraph-equivalant data via snapshots at specific blockheights
2. `proxy-eq` — verify live query compatibility & easing migrations from the Subgraph to ENSNode by identifying any response discrepancies while using an app in real-time

See the [ens-subgraph-transition-tools](https://github.com/namehash/ens-subgraph-transition-tools) README for additional context and usage instructions.

## `snapshot-eq` — `CLUSTER`ing

When running the `snapshot` tool, extremely inefficient `OFFSET` (`skip`) based queries are executed to paginate through every resource in the database. The duration of these queries increases as `OFFSET` grows, quickly becoming untenable.

A stop-gap solution is to `CLUSTER` all of the tables before taking a snapshot, which re-orders the rows on-disk by their id, which is how the queries are ordered and executed. This drastically improves query times for large `OFFSET`s by 5x or 10x.

### Ponder-compatible `CLUSTER` function

The following is a helper to cluster every table in a ponder index schema (i.e. `DATABASE_SCHEMA=public`) by its primary key index. Run this before performing a snapshot against ENSNode.

```sql
-- Function to generate and execute CLUSTER commands for public tables
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION cluster_all_tables() RETURNS void AS $$
DECLARE
    table_record record;
    table_name text;
    primary_index text;
    cluster_command text;
BEGIN
    -- Loop through tables in public schema only
    FOR table_record IN
        SELECT
            c.relname as table_name,
            (SELECT ci.relname
             FROM pg_class ci
             WHERE ci.oid = i.indexrelid) as index_name
        FROM pg_class c
        JOIN pg_namespace n ON n.oid = c.relnamespace
        -- Join with pg_index to get primary key indexes
        JOIN pg_index i ON i.indrelid = c.oid
        WHERE
            -- Regular tables only
            c.relkind = 'r'
            -- Only public schema
            AND n.nspname = 'public'
            -- Exclude tables starting with underscore
            AND c.relname NOT LIKE '\_%'
            -- Primary key indexes only
            AND i.indisprimary
        ORDER BY c.relname
    LOOP
        table_name := table_record.table_name;
        primary_index := table_record.index_name;

        IF primary_index IS NOT NULL AND primary_index != '' THEN
            -- Build and execute CLUSTER command
            cluster_command := format('CLUSTER %I USING %I',
                                    table_name,
                                    primary_index);

            RAISE NOTICE 'Executing: %', cluster_command;

            -- Execute the CLUSTER command
            EXECUTE cluster_command;

            -- Log completion
            RAISE NOTICE 'Clustered table % using index %',
                        table_name,
                        primary_index;
        ELSE
            RAISE NOTICE 'Skipping table % - no valid primary key index found',
                        table_name;
        END IF;
    END LOOP;

    RAISE NOTICE 'All public tables have been clustered successfully.';
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- Execute the function to cluster all tables
SELECT cluster_all_tables();
```
