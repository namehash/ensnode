# Applications Dependent on ENS Subgraph

## Overview

The ENS Subgraph serves as a critical infrastructure component in the Ethereum Name Service ecosystem, providing indexed data that powers a wide range of applications and services. This page documents the extensive ecosystem that has been built around and depends on the ENS Subgraph, demonstrating why a robust replacement (ENSNode) is necessary for ENSv2.

## ENS Subgraph Usage Metrics

The ENS Subgraph is a cornerstone of the current ENS architecture (ENSv1), handling an extraordinary volume of requests:

- **Almost 2 million daily requests**
- **Over 717 million requests annually**

This massive query volume underscores the central importance of the ENS Subgraph in the current ecosystem and demonstrates the scale at which any replacement solution must operate.
