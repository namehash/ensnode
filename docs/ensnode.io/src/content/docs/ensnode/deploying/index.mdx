:::note
Follow these guides to deploy an ENSNode instance to the cloud.
:::

Running your own ENSNode instance is helpful for those that wish to:
- Maintain control over their own infrastructure
- Ensure control over their own availability and uptime guarantees
- Customize ENSNode's behavior
- Own the resulting Postgres index for custom queries or `JOIN`s

:::note[Private Networking]
Note that because ENSNode makes many label healing requests to ENSRainbow while indexing, it's _imperative_ that they be on the same local network to minimize request time.
