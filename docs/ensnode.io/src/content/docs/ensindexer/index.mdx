ENSIndexer is a [Ponder](https://ponder.sh) app that indexes ENS contracts across multiple chains. It processes events from each relevant chain and transforms the data, storing it in your Postgres database.

:::note
While ENSIndexer can be run independently in certain scenarios, it is designed to work as part of the complete ENSNode system, and we recommend following the [ENSNode Contribution Guide](/docs/contributing/) if you'd like to run ENSIndexer locally, or the [ENSNode Deployment Guide](/docs/deploying/) if you'd like to run ENSIndexer in the cloud.
:::

## Configuration

ENSIndexer can be configured via environment variables.
