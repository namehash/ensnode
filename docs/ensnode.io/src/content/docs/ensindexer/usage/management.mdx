### Dropping Orphaned Indexing Schemas

When re-deploying any Ponder indexer, including ENSNode a new schema is created (via the `DATABASE_SCHEMA` env variable) and the previous schemas are abandoned. They remain available for rollbacks, but take up database spaceâ€”dropping these schemas once no longer available is useful for reclaiming space in your Postgres instance.

```sql
DROP SCHEMA <schema name> CASCADE;
```

### `ponder_sync` Schema

Ponder internal state schema, notably holds the RPC Cache. If you'd like to drop your RPC cache and any internal Ponder state, you can:

```sql
DROP SCHEMA ponder_sync CASCADE;
```
