## Hosted Instances
- There are available hosted instances ready to use for end clients. These instances are maintained by the ENSNode team.
- **Reliability:** The ENSNode team makes sure the service is always available, so you can access it whenever you need.
- **Maintenance-Free:** Clients do not need to manage infrastructure or updates.
- **Scalability:** Easily scale usage without worrying about underlying resources.
- **Support:** Access to dedicated support from the ENSNode team for any issues.

## ENSNode instances

There are two ENSNode deployments which are serving indexed ENS data. Both are separate deployment which may run on different versions and configurations.
Main difference from client perspective is list of plugins which each instance handlers. Here is the table listing differences between those two.
