```

basically an API server that stitches together these data sources to enable the more realtime/dynamic aspects of this data. label healing information changes all the time, CCIP reads are off-chain data, etc. the api layer implements a cache for both the label healing and ccip read sources for performant loads but relatively fresh reads


## label healing service

this service would ideally run its own ponder indexer that tracks healed labels emitted on-chain, as well as other data sources (rainbow tables, etc) and provides those as an api. it should

- tracks on-chain sources of healed names
- embeds existing rainbow tables
- embeds/tracks/sources any other source of healed names
- ignores any healed name with a null byte
  - TL;DR: postgres doesn't store null bytes, so should ignore any healed labels that include a null byte
  - https://ens.mirror.xyz/9GN77d-MqGvRypm72FcwgxlUnPSuKWhG3rWxddHhRwM
- stores a list of all possible healed names, regardless of normalization status
- (cron? on-demand?) iterate all yet-normalized names in the db, if is normalized, store in rainbow table of `hash -> healed`
- provide rainbowtable lookups to api service

this structure is because normalization changes over time, so set of valid healed names changes over time. any normalized name will never become invalid (in theory), so once added the the rainbow table it can live there forever. if this assumption is every incorrect, once can triviually re-index the healed names list to generate the rainbowtable

## indexer improvement notes

the 'empty' domains should be handled more accurately, depending on how important serving empty domains is for people.

- `Domain#subdomainCount` could/should be a computed property by count(children of parent)
  - removes need to recursively update parent records during domain delete
  - removes need to increment during domain creation
  - new impl likely needs to exclude 'empty' domains (see registry notes for context)

domain createdAt should not update on re-registration, should be original createdAt

various resources use both null and zeroAddress to indicate emptiness, this is horrible and creates numerous checks like [this](https://github.com/ensdomains/ensjs/blob/main/packages/ensjs/src/functions/subgraph/getNamesForAddress.ts#L255) where they check for `!== NULL && !== zeroAddress`

wrappedOwnerId should not be materialized onto domain, should just be resolved through wrappedDomain.owner

### ens indexing plugin

l2 ens deployments are very similar — write plugin to make configuring source addresses easy and pass node that domains in these handlers are implicitly parented to (assuming that l2 deployments make nodes against the ROOT_NODE i.e. every name is basically a 2LD)

### registry

- in `Registry:NewOwner`, the event emits `node` and `label`, `node` should be named `parent` and the computed subnode should be named `node` or `domain`
- empty domains aren't actually deleted from the index, but if a domain is empty the parent's subdomain count is reduced appropriately. options:
  1. if historical info not important (still available by blockheight queries), domains should be deleted, and `subdomainCount` computed with a simple count query
  2. if domain existance is necesssary, make `subdomainCount` computed with a where clause to exclude 'empty' domains
  3. if filters against subdomainCount are necessary, maybe the current logic works just fine

### label healing

label healing should be implemented outside of the indexer (see architecture above). this means removing the relevant fields (`name`, `labelName`) from the indexing schema and removing the label healing code in `Registry.ts`

iff filters against the healed name need to be supported, the cache can be persisted to the same postgres to support performant joins against indexer data

### resolver

- the local `Resolver` resource should be keyed by `CAIP-10 ID`, not pairwise ala subgraph, to match on-chain datamodel
  - the handlers should persist all keys and values emitted by the resolver in `Records`
  - the `Record` model stores (`node`, `key`, `value`) and is keyed by (`resolverId`, `node`, `key`)
  - on active resolver change, simply point the domain's `resolverId` to the resolver's address
  - any domain's records are computed through the current `resolverId` and querying

any resolver that implements the CCIP Read standard will have to have its records implemented at the API layer which can stitch the indexed data with realtime offchain data via CCIP Reads. if we don't want to implement the CCIP Read proxy as part of this unified api, the api should know if a Resolver defers to CCIP and communicate that effectively in the response so that clients can do it themselves.

in the subgraph implementation, resolver handlers must upsert resolvers because people can set records etc for a node that has not (yet) specified this resolver as active, meaning the create in `Registry:NewResolver` has yet to fire.

resolvers should be keyed by `(chainId, address)` and manage a mapping of records for a node, to be more protocol-centric. `coinTypes` and `texts` keys & values should be fully indexed (if possible — intentionally ignored in the subgraph because of some historical reason...)

> Yes, when it comes to all forms of key -> value pairs that comprise resolver records, the ENS Subgraph only indexes the keys and not the values. The motivation for this comes from a concern that some apps might improperly decide to use the ENS Subgraph as a source of truth for resolver record values, rather than ENS protocol standards for how resolver record values should be dynamically looked up. A naive implementation that considers the ENS Subgraph as a source of truth for these can cause a lot of problems.

### registrar

the subgraph implements all of the BaseRegistrar, EthRegistrarController, and EthRegistrarControllerOld logic together

### api

- the subgraph schema has a few fields an `Account` but clients probably only want the account's address, so we might as well just store the string there instead of making it a reference. clients incur some effort flattening the returned strucutre: https://github.com/ensdomains/ensjs/blob/main/packages/ensjs/src/functions/subgraph/getNameHistory.ts#L223
