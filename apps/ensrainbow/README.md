# ENSRainbow

ENSRainbow is a label healing sidecar service for ENS names. It provides a simple API endpoint to heal ENS labelhashes back to their original labels.

Special thanks to [The Graph Protocol](https://github.com/graphprotocol/ens-rainbow) for their work on the original ENS Rainbow project and rainbow table generation.
