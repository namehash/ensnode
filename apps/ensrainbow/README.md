# ENSRainbow

ENSRainbow a service for healing ENS labels. It provides a simple API endpoint to heal ENS labelhashes back to their original labels.

## Documentation

For detailed documentation and guides, see the [ENSRainbow Documentation](https://ensnode.io/ensrainbow).

## Architecture Overview

For backwards compatibility with the ENS Subgraph, the current rainbow tables (6.37 GB) are exactly the same as those published by [The Graph](https://github.com/graphprotocol/ens-rainbow) which are [MIT licensed](https://bucket.ensrainbow.io/THE_GRAPH_LICENSE.txt).

- **Storage Layer**: Uses LevelDB as an embedded key-value store to efficiently map labelhashes to their original labels
- **API Layer**: Exposes a REST API endpoint that accepts labelhashes and returns the corresponding original label
- **Data Ingestion**: Processes a pre-computed rainbow table (SQL dump) to populate the LevelDB store
- **Performance**: Provides fast, constant-time lookups for known ENS labels through LevelDB's efficient indexing

The service is designed to be run as a sidecar alongside ENSNode, helping to "heal" the labelhashes of unknown labels by finding their original labels when available.

## Current Release & Future Direction

The initial release of ENSRainbow focuses on backwards compatibility with the ENS Subgraph, providing the same label healing capabilities that ENS ecosystem tools rely on today. However, we're actively working on significant enhancements that will expand ENSRainbow's healing capabilities far beyond what's currently possible with the ENS Subgraph. These upcoming features will allow ENSRainbow to heal many previously unknown labels, making it an even more powerful tool for ENS data analysis and integration.

## Special Thanks

Special thanks to [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) for their work to generate the [original ENS rainbow table](https://github.com/graphprotocol/ens-rainbow) and [ENS Labs](https://www.enslabs.org/) for developing the [ENS Subgraph](https://github.com/ensdomains/ens-subgraph).
