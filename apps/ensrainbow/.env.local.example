# ENSRAINBOW DATABASE CONFIGURATION
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This section configures the ENSRainbow database that the Docker
# container will download on its first startup. This approach keeps the Docker
# image small and allows data to be updated independently of the application code.

# --- Database Schema Version ---
#
# Definition: Specifies the version of the physical database layout. It is not
#             related to the application's API version.
#
# Goal: Ensures the application's code is compatible with the on-disk database
#       format. Think of it like a migration version for a traditional database.
#
# How to configure: You should almost always use the latest available version
# (e.g., `3`) to run the most recent and efficient database structure. Only use
# an older version if you have a specific, legacy system requirement.
DB_SCHEMA_VERSION=3

# --- Label Set ID ---
#
# See https://ensnode.io/ensrainbow/concepts/glossary/ for definition of "label set".
#
# How to configure: Choose the Label Set ID that matches your needs.
# - `subgraph`:  The current production dataset. Use this for current production applications.
# - `ens-test-env`:   A very small, lightweight dataset used for testing with the ens-test-env.
# - `searchlight`: (Future) An extended dataset with additional label discoveries.
# - `discovery-a`:  (Future) A dataset for dynamically discovered labels.
LABEL_SET_ID=ens-test-env

# --- Label Set Version ---
#
# See https://ensnode.io/ensrainbow/concepts/glossary/ for definition of "label set".
#
# How to configure:
# - To get the most up-to-date data, use the highest available version number
#   for your chosen `LABEL_SET_ID`. Versions start at `0`.
# - If you need to reproduce a result from an earlier point in time, you would
#   use a specific, older version number.
LABEL_SET_VERSION=0
