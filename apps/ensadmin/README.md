pnpm install
```

cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Available environment variables:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_CONNECTION_LIBRARY` - Comma-separated list of ENSNode URLs offered as connection options (defaults to NameHash's hosted instances)
- `ENSADMIN_PUBLIC_URL` - The public URL where ENSAdmin is hosted (optional, auto-detected for Vercel)

### Run development server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

The development server runs on http://localhost:4173

docker build -f apps/ensadmin/Dockerfile -t ensadmin .
```

### Run Docker container
