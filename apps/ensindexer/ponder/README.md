This is Ponder's `root` directory, where it looks for:

- `./ponder-env.d.ts` (autogenerated, types for the virtual modules `ponder:internal` and `ponder:schema`)
- `./ponder.config.ts` — where ponder actually loads the ponder config
- `./ponder.schema.ts` — where ponder actually sources the drizzle schema
- `./src/api/index.ts` — a hono app which ponder serves on `PORT` (default 42069)
- `./src/*.ts` — ponder.on handler registrations
    - specifically `./src/register-handlers.ts`, where we centralize the conditional registration of our plugin-specific handlers

We use a custom root to keep ENSIndexer's application source files in `apps/ensindexer/src/`, without conflicting with ponder's expectation that the root (default `apps/ensindexer/src`) only contains handlers and not, for example, vitest test files.

By using a custom ponder root we get the following properties:
1. Code stays in `src/`, which is a nice pattern consistent with the rest of the codebase, and
2. The Ponder app itself is logically isolated from the rest of the ensindexer codebase
  - this allows us to colocate test files with their implementations and the import dependency graph excludes them when ponder bundles the files in the root.
