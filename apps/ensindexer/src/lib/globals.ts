/**
 * Note that here, we define the global MERGED_ENS_DEPLOYMENT as the _merge_ of mainnet (which fully

 *
 * This ensures that at type-check-time and in `ALL_PLUGINS` every plugin's `config` has valid values
 * (and therefore its type can continue to be inferred). This means that initially upon building the
 * plugin configs, if the user is selecting a deployment that does not fully specify every available
 * plugin, the plugins that are not in that deployment's specification are technically pointing at
 * the mainnet deployment. This is never an issue, however, as those plugin are filtered out
 * (see ponder.config.ts and `getActivePlugins`) and never activated.
