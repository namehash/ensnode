/**
 * These characters are prohibited in normalized ENS names per the ENSIP-15
 * standard (https://docs.ens.domains/ensip/15). Names containing labels with
 * one or more of these characters are unusable by any app implementing
 * ENSIP-15 (e.g., via https://github.com/adraffy/ens-normalize.js
 * or https://github.com/namehash/ens-normalize-python).
 *
 * While many other characters (beyond these 4) are not supported by
 * ENSIP-15, only the following 4 characters are classified as "unindexable" due
 * to specific indexing concerns.
 *
 * Onchain ENS contracts do not enforce ENSIP-15 normalization for reasons
 * including the gas costs of enforcement. This allows unnormalized labels
 * containing these characters to exist onchain. Such labels must be handled
 * carefully by indexers to avoid conflicts.
 *
 * Some indexed labels are "unknown" (or "unindexable") but still require a
 * representation within indexed data. For this purpose, a special "unknown
 * label" format is defined that represents these labels in the format of
 * "[{labelhash}]" where {labelhash} is the labelhash of the unknown label.
 * When an indexed label is in this format it is necessary to distinguish an
 * "unknown" label containing a labelhash, from an unnormalized label literal
 * that is formatted to appear like an "unknown" label. For example, if the
 * unnormalized label literal
 * "[24695ee963d29f0f52edfdea1e830d2fcfc9052d5ba70b194bddd0afbbc89765]"
 * is indexed, it will be considered "unindexable" (due to the square bracket
 * characters) and therefore be represented as the following "unknown" label instead
 * "[80968d00b78a91f47b233eaa213576293d16dadcbbdceb257bca94b08451ba7f]"
 * which encodes the labelhash of the unnormalized label literal in
 * square brackets.

/**
 * NOTE: there seems to be a bug in ensjs#bytesToPacket regarding malformed names, which we were
 * originally using for this function.
 *
 * For example, in this tx `0x4ece50ae828f2a0f27f45d086e85a55e6284bff31a0a89daca9df4b1b1f5cb75` the
 * `name` input is `8436.eth` (it should have been just `8436`, as the `.eth` is inferred).
 *
 * This operates against a name that actually looks like `[fb1d24d5dc41613d5b4874e6cccb06ecf442f6f1773c3771c4fcce1161985a18].eth`
 * which results in a namehash of `0xfb1d24d5dc41613d5b4874e6cccb06ecf442f6f1773c3771c4fcce1161985a18`
 * and the NameWrapper emits an event with the packet bytes of `08383433362E6574680365746800`.
 * when ensjs#bytesToPacket sees these bytes, it returns a name of `8436.eth.eth`, which is incorrect.
 *
 * The original subgraph logic handled this case correctly, it seems, and so we re-implement it here.
 * https://github.com/ensdomains/ens-subgraph/blob/master/src/nameWrapper.ts#L30
 *
 * More information about this discussion can be found in this thread:
 * https://github.com/namehash/ensnode/issues/36
 *
 * TODO: replace this function with ensjs#bytesToPacket when it correctly handles these cases. See
 * commit hash bace0ab55077d9f5cd37bd9d6638c4acb16334a8 for an example implementation.
